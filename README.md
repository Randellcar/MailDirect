# Mail-Direct
Mail-Direct is a mobile application that notifies TCNJ residents when their mailbox has mail. Mail-Direct utilizes sensors to
detect when mail has been placed in a resident's mailbox. The data from the sensors is set to an Arduino system which will 
be later pushed into a server through WiFi. The mobile app portion then pulls this information from the server, thus informing 
the user whether or not they have mail in their mailbox. Other features to be included are email notifications, push 
notifications, and text notifications.
